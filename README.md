# DIGEST Hyper-Markdown

Turns markdown files and folder structure into websites

Author:  Phil Grunewald

Licence: MIT (see docs)

Version: v0.4

Date:   3 June 23

Summary
=======

Project repository for website and file sharing.

Use
---

- Clone this repository ```git clone digest@edol.uk:/var/www/energy-use.org/public_html/digest/.git```
- Edit files in `_src`
- Add, commit, push

Done! The website is automatically updated.

Serve locally
-------------

To try out the look before pushing, run ```python _res/post-update```.
Content is generated in the `site` folder.

NOTE: DO NOT ADD the `site` folder to the repository. It is automatically generated remotely on `push`.


Conventions
-----------

- All folders that contain an `index.md` file get listed in the menu
- Files and folders starting with `_` are ignored
- The first three markdown lines with a leading '%' are treated as `title, author and date`
- The current folder and any parents are listed in the menu's top row
- Subfolders are listed on the second row (one level deep)
- All pages within a folder are listed as boxes
- Everything is ordered by `date modified` (unless specified in `order.txt` within a folder)
- Files other than `.md` get copied as are (e.g. html,js,php,css,png,svg,jpg,jpeg,pdf)

Config
------

The `_res/config.json` file contains the following settings:

`Logo`: if a logo is specified, this is used instead of the `Title` in the top left corner of each page

Styling
-------

The `_src/css/site.css` style is used by default. Modify this file to affect all pages or add custom css files to override/add styles for specific pages. In markdown identify the css file by adding the line

`% custom.css`

anywhere in the text.


Cross-referencing
-----------------

The _\$_ symbol acts are the root of the site. To link `source/Folder1/text1.md` use

```markdown
  [Text 1]($Folder1/text1.md)
```

as the url from any sub-folder. Relative links work as normal. (Note that the target file ends

Short links
-----------

Short links can be declared in `res/config.json` under `Links`:

```json
{
  "F1t1": "Folder1/text1.html"
}
```

```markdown
  [Text 1]($F1t1)
```

now resolves to the `Folder1/text1.html` file, via a redirection file (`F1t1/index.html`)


Custom classes
--------------

Classes can be added to links and images with a trailing `%`:

```markdown
   ![Image caption]($img/navajo.png)%big
```

Style classes are declared in `source/css/site.css` and can be modified to suit.

Predefined classes include:

- `right`: small image placed on the right
- `right-up`: small image placed on the right and raised higher (to sit next to a header for example)
- `toggle`: when clicked the image goes big/small
- `icon`: large image with defaults removed
- `inline`: small image
- `person`: round and greyscale image
- `big`: full width
- `preview`: 150px, but at least 10% of the page width

Boxes
-----

The same box layout that is applied to pages within a folder can be used for linked pages.

A link followed by `%box` is renedered as a box, using page `title, author and date` from the first three lines for content.

Wrapping multiple boxes between `%flex` and `%/flex` comments ensures that they wrap on the page.

```
 %flex

 []($absolute_path)%box

 [Title, address, date, img](relative_path)%box

 %/flex
```

Banners
-------

Each page has a banner across the top. The default is specified in `_res/config.json` under `Banner`.
The specified file is taken from the `_src/img` folder, unless a file with that name exists locally. To customise the **banner for an entire folder**, place a file with the same name in that folder.
For a **single page**, add a line containing:

```% banner: mybanner.png```
