CoI-Phil Grünewald FICE (Technical Research lead), Oxford Martin Fellow and College Lecturer in Engineering at the University of Oxford, has pioneered novel data collection methods combining proprietary electricity recorders and mobile apps to gather activity diary data from UK households. Phil’s group also developed machine learning approaches to disaggregate and attribute energy use to activity patterns and appliances. His current projects include ReNEW (Reconfiguring Energy Needs, Equity and Wellbeing) for which he developed mobile smart meter access for participant feedback. Until 2021 Phil held an EPSRC Early Career Fellowship and was PI of METER, Measuring and Evaluating Time- and Energy-use Relationships (EP/M024652/1). In 2016 he became a Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers by presidential appointment. He has held advisory roles for BEIS and the Carbon Trust, has given evidence to the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, and has previously won the RWE/nPower Energy Challenge.
