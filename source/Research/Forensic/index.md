Summary
-------

The Forensic Laboratories deploy in-depth and qualitative approaches to understand energy use and the individual household level.

Households are chosen for forensic analysis based on their energy use characteristincs. Participants who consent to being part of a Forensic Lab will recieve personal visits from building experts and social scientists. This personalised approach allows us to understand energy needs in a way that sensors alone cannot. This part of our research focusses on the question of _why_ we use energy in the way that we do.
