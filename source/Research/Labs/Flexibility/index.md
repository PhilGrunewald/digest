% Flexibility lab
% Assessing the social and technical conditions for responsive demand

%type: lab

Participating households periodically receive requests to reduce their electricity or gas consumption. We use electronic activity diaries to assess the impact of such measures on everyday life and seek to understand which conditions (social and technical) give rise to high or low capacity to shift energy demand.

The instruments of this lab have been developed with help of UKRI [EP/M024652/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/M024652/1) and the [Oxford Martin School](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/).
