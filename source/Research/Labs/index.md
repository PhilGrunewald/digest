EDOL laboratories use EDOL standards for data collection and curation to assess the impact of policies, technologies or other effects on energy demand. The EDOL Observatory acts as the control group for EDOL Laboratories. The treatment effect of a Laboratory can thus be validated against parallel observations of comparable cohorts in the Observatory.

EDOL supports the creation of new Laboratories. If you are interested in setting up a Laboratory, please contact [The EDOL Team]($Team)
