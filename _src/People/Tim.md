Tim's research focuses on the analysis and technology to develop a zero carbon electricity supply system that is dominated by variable renewable sources and other inverter-based resources (IBR) such as battery energy storage. Such a system raises many challenges over how regulation of frequency and voltage, detection and location of faults and damping of unstable modes are ensured without the traditional synchronous generators that provide services in these areas. With colleagues Balarko Chaudhuri and Yunjie Gu, I attempt to provide the analysis tools and control innovations that solve these problems. A particular focus is on data-led (as opposed to physics-led) models for assessing whole-system stability. The approach is motivated by the opaqueness of the models of the IBR control software available from vendors. Here the term stability covers small-signal stability, large-signal stability such as fault ride-through, voltage recovery and frequency stability. I also attempt to address the problems of protection relying in inverter-dominated networks.
